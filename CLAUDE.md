# Track Splitter

A small local app that takes instruments out of songs, so a musician can play along
(the original use case: remove the bass to practice bass). Upload songs or paste a
link, pick what to remove (bass, drums, vocals, guitar, piano), and it produces a
version without those parts plus the removed part on its own. Everything runs on the
user's own computer; no audio leaves the machine.

Primary user runs it on a MacBook Pro (M4); it was developed and tested on Windows
(CPU only). It has also been run successfully on a second, fresh Mac from git.

## Files

- `app.py`: everything server-side: the separation engine, the library on disk, the
  processing queue, and a FastAPI web API. Also serves the page and creates the app
  shortcut. Run with `python app.py` (port 7860, opens the browser).
- `static/index.html`: the whole UI in one file (HTML + CSS + vanilla JS, no build
  step, no external downloads so it works offline).
- `start.sh` (Mac/Linux) / `start.bat` (Windows): create `.venv` on first run, reinstall
  packages whenever `requirements.txt` is newer than `.venv/.installed`, then start.
- `requirements.txt`: torch, torchaudio, demucs, fastapi, uvicorn, python-multipart,
  imageio-ffmpeg, numpy, send2trash, yt-dlp, truststore.
- `track-splitter.zip`: an email-sized copy of the app (git-ignored). Email filters
  block `.bat`, so inside the zip it is `start.bat.txt`; never commit that name.

## How separation works

- Demucs v4 (Meta, open source). Standard quality = `htdemucs`; High quality =
  `htdemucs_ft`; guitar and piano = `htdemucs_6s` (the only model with those stems,
  less precise, no HQ variant, so HQ is disabled in the UI when only guitar/piano are
  picked).
- `htdemucs_ft` is a bag of 4 per-stem specialists. `stem_model()` runs only the
  specialist(s) needed: identical output to the full bag, ~4x faster. (Outputs differ
  slightly run to run only because of Demucs' random time shift, `shifts=1`.)
- The "without" track is `original - removed_parts * (1 - level)`, so everything not
  removed is untouched. "Only" is the removed parts. Playing both together in the
  player equals the original, which is how the player's Original mode works.
- Device: CUDA if present, else Apple MPS, else CPU. MPS lacks some ops:
  `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1` is set before torch loads, and `run_model()` retries
  a song on the CPU if MPS still raises.
- Audio decode/encode goes through the ffmpeg binary from `imageio-ffmpeg` (no system
  ffmpeg needed). Output is 192 kbps MP3 at 44.1 kHz.
- Progress comes from Demucs' `apply_model(callback=...)` (segment offsets).

## Library on disk

Lives in `~/Music/Track Splitter/`, outside the project, so app updates never touch it.

```
<Artist>/<Song>/
  original.<ext>               the uploaded/downloaded file (lets new versions be made without re-uploading)
  <Song> (no bass).mp3         one pair of files per version
  <Song> (bass only).mp3
  <Song> [HQ] (no drums & vocals).mp3 / ... (drums & vocals only).mp3
  .song.json                   {"sha1", "source", "added"}: sha1 of the original spots repeat uploads
```

- Ids: artist = `Artist`, song = `Artist/Song`, version = `Artist/Song/<Song> (no X)`.
  `library_path(id, depth)` validates every id (no `..`, must stay inside the library).
- Songs without an artist go to `Unknown artist`.
- The filesystem is the database (no separate index); `library()` scans it.
- Startup migrations (`migrate_old_library`): moves the old `~/Music/Bass Remover` and
  `./output` libraries in, then turns the earlier flat layout (`Artist/Song (no bass).mp3`)
  into song folders. Those older songs have no original; the UI asks for the file once
  ("+ Version" -> attach original -> make version).
- Deletes go to the Trash (send2trash), never permanent.
- Renames handle case-only changes (Mac/Windows filesystems ignore case) via a temp name.

## Adding songs (two steps)

1. Stage: `POST /api/stage` (files) or `POST /api/stage-link` (URL via yt-dlp). Reads
   title/artist from tags, or guesses from the file/video name ("03 - Artist - Song
   (Official Video)" -> Artist / Song), and flags duplicates by sha1.
2. Process: `POST /api/process` with staged ids (or existing song ids for a new
   version), instruments, level, hq. One background worker thread processes jobs in
   order; the page polls `GET /api/jobs/{id}`.

yt-dlp is used the standard way, with no cookies or bot-check workarounds. This is
deliberate: YouTube's "confirm you're not a bot" check blocked it on the user's work
network, and getting around bot detection was declined. The app just explains that
error (and certificate errors) in plain language.

`truststore.inject_into_ssl()` makes Python trust the OS certificate store (Mac
Keychain), which fixed a certificate error on the Mac; certificate checking stays on.

## UI (static/index.html)

- Sidebar: All songs, artists (hover ... -> rename/merge, delete; + New artist; drop a
  song row on an artist to move it), device label, Open library folder, Create app
  shortcut, Quit.
- Main: searchable song list; each row shows version chips (click to play) and
  "+ Version"; row ... menu: New version, Edit song (rename, change artist, delete
  versions), Delete song.
- Player bar: two `<audio>` elements kept in lockstep (without + only); the
  Without / Original / Only switch just changes their volumes.
- Add songs dialog: drop files or paste a link, edit title/artist per item, pick
  instruments, level, HQ. Upload is disabled until the required fields are filled. On
  success the songs clear and the dialog closes; settings persist (localStorage).
- Dark theme, violet accent, system font; fits one screen down to ~1024x768 and
  collapses for narrow windows.

## Launching without a terminal

- The app asks before creating a shortcut (welcome card, "Don't ask me again" stored in
  localStorage). Mac: `~/Applications/Track Splitter.app` whose launcher runs `start.sh`
  in the background (log: `~/Library/Logs/Track Splitter.log`) or reopens the page if
  already running. Windows: Desktop `.lnk` running `pythonw.exe app.py` (does not
  reinstall packages; untested on a real desktop).
- Starting a second copy just opens the browser. Quit in the sidebar stops the server
  (`POST /api/quit`).
- The static files are mounted last in `app.py`; any new `/api/...` route must be
  defined before `api.mount("/", ...)` or it will 404.

## Testing approach used so far

No test suite in the repo. Changes were verified by running the server on a spare port
(`app.main(port=7866, open_browser=False)`), driving the API with small scripts
(upload, poll, move, delete, bad ids), and clicking through the page in a browser. A
synthetic 15 s clip (sine bass line + chords + clicks) was used, measuring how much
40-100 Hz energy remains to confirm bass removal.

## Open ideas / to do

- Windows polish: accept any recent Python (start.bat hard-codes `py -3.13`), make the
  desktop shortcut install package updates like the Mac one, use an NVIDIA GPU (needs
  the CUDA build of torch; the default Windows build is CPU-only).
- Playlists / practice sets that pull songs from any artist.
- The user once asked for "filters": interpreted as folders; filtering the song list
  (by instrument removed, HQ, etc.) may still be wanted.
- Rhythm vs lead guitar separation was asked about: not possible with Demucs (one
  "guitar" stem); only a stereo-position trick that works on some recordings.
- Mac-only paths (app shortcut, MPS fallback, certificate fix) were written on Windows;
  they have been reported working on Mac but have no automated checks.
